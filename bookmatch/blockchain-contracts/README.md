# react-solidity-hardhat template

This template sets up a combination of Solidity smart contracts and a React front-end app that interacts with these
smart contracts.  
This template includes:

- [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/) smart contract library.
- [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) smart contract development tooling.
- [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) for smart contract interaction.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) + [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/).
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) for dev tooling.

The project is configured to deploy on "[Passet Hub](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpasset-hub-paseo.ibp.network#/accounts)" network

## Setting up environment

First, set up Metamask wallet for Passet Hub network, and get some PAS there. ([docs](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/smart-contracts/wallets/))  
In `contracts` directory, set up private key for hardhat:

```
npx hardhat vars set PRIVATE_KEY "INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY"
```

## 1. Writing smart contracts

Contracts are written in `contracts/contracts`. Each smart contract has a Hardhat Ignition module counterpart in `contracts/igniton/modules`. More on that in [Hardhat Ignition docs](https://hardhat.org/ignition/docs/getting-started#overview).

1. Edit smart contracts in `contracts/contracts`
2. Edit ignition module in `contracts/igniton/modules`
3. Run `npx hardhat compile` to compile smart contracts
4. Run `npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/<ModuleName>.ts --network polkadotHubTestnet` to deploy them

### Note on committing `ignition/deployments`

This is a directory that contains build and deployment artifacts from `hardhat`.
They aren't ignored, becuase they are used for types generation for frontend: if there's a smart contract already deployed, you may want to keep it in git, so a fresh clone would give you a working frontend.

However, several issues with hardhat are resolved by removing `ignition/deployments` directory, to start fresh deployment. These issues include:

```
An unexpected error occurred:

Error: Could not parse row {...
```

```
[ MyTokenModule ] reconciliation failed â›”

The module contains changes to executed futures:
...
```

In such cases, do `rm -rf ignition/deployments`, deploy the new contract, and commit the artifacts anew :)

## 2. Interacting with smart contracts from frontend app

1. Generate types from deployed smart contracts by running `npm run generate` in `frontend` directory
2. Run `npm run dev` to start `vite` environment
3. You can import contract ABI and deployed addresses from `src/generated.ts`:

```ts
import {
  myTokenModuleMyTokenAddress,
  myTokenModuleMyTokenAbi,
} from "./generated";

const contractAddress = myTokenModuleMyTokenAddress[420420422];
// ...
writeContract({
  address: contractAddress,
  abi: myTokenModuleMyTokenAbi,
  functionName: "mint",
  args: [address, BigInt(amount) * 10n ** BigInt(params.decimals)],
});
```
